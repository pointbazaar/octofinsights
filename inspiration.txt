LEAD STATUS
- open_not_contacted
- open_contacted
- open_awaiting_response
- closed_not_converted
- closed_converted


FEATURE IDEAS:
- ability to sort sales and expenses and tables in general by their fields
- ability to create tasks related to leads/opportunities
- lead source (where a lead came from, can be a person,website and so on)
    - this should be with category
- probability of a lead or opportunity close, meaning that the sale will happen
    - based on previous data for similar leads and sales
- every lead should have a "next step" field unless it is closed
